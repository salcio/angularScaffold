To load dependencies:
Npm install

Npm start : to host the website locally, we can use IIS to keep consistent with production environment
Npm test : to run the jasmine test, etc


All thanks to Jammy we have:
grunt deployDev : to deploy the site with dev settings
grunt deployProd : to deploy the site with production settings, this also takes care of minification and bundling
